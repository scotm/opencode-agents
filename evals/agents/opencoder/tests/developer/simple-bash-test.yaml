description: |
  Test that opencoder can execute a simple bash command directly.
  Opencoder executes tools without text-based approval workflow.
  
  NOTE: Opencoder intentionally skips text-based approval (uses tool permissions only).
  The approval-gate evaluator will flag this, but it's expected behavior for opencoder.
